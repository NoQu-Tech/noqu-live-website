        <h4>PRIVACY POLICY FOR NoQu TECH SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED</h4>
        <p>At NoQu (including its subsidiaries or affiliated companies, hereinafter referred to as ‘NoQu’, ‘We’ or the
            ‘Company’), We understand that you are trusting us with confidential information and We believe that you
            have the right to know our practices regarding the information We may collect and use when you use our
            service or interact with us in any manner.</p>
        <p>This delineates the kinds of personal data We collect via the Platform, how We may utilize such data and the
            parties with whom We may share it. Additionally, We provide guidance on how you can contact us to update
            your preferences regarding communication or to address any inquiries you may have about our privacy
            protocols.</p>
        <p><b>NoQu</b> is a cloud-based SaaS platform that enables organizations to manage Time & Attendance and other
            related services. NoQu Mobile Apps are also included in this offering. In addition, NoQu operates the
            website www.noqu.in. A User may be either an entity, such as an Employer that has executed an agreement with
            NoQu or with NoQu’s resellers or distributors who provide NoQu’s services (“Customer”) or a Customer’s Users
            such as a Customer’s employees, who uses the Services or the website (“End Users”). (Customers and End Users
            shall collectively be referred to as “Users” or “you”).</p>
        <h5>SCOPE OF POLICY</h5>
        <p>This policy together with our Terms of Use applies to your use of:</p>
        <p>The <b>Account owner</b> is NoQu’s administrator for his/her company’s account created within NoQu. The
            Account Owner has full rights over the company account data and can create other company’s Users and grant
            them data access permissions. The Account Owner is responsible for all data entered, including employee
            images, demographic data, and any other data related to company employees and users.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes NoQu's policies and procedures on the collection, use, access, correction, and
            disclosure of your personal information on noqu.in (the “Site”), our Mobile Apps and Admin Web Dashboard.
            Your personal information includes any information which, either alone or with other data, is reasonably
            available to us or relates to you (“Personal Information”). This Privacy Policy also covers any of your
            Personal Information provided to us in connection with marketing of the services, features or content We
            offer (the “Services”) to our clients and/or the support We may give you with the provision of our Services
            and Mobile Apps.</p>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software accessible through the Site,
            the Services or the Mobile Apps, such as social media websites or partner websites (“Third-Party Services”).
            By using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this privacy policy. For purposes
            of the GDPR or European Economic Area data protection law (the “Data Protection Law”), the data controller
            of the data processed through the Service is the Customer who makes it available and permits End Users to
            access and use the Service or anyone on its behalf. For data retained through the website data processed
            outside the Service (i.e. contact details of potential customers or resumes submitted to us by potential
            employees for the purpose of engagement with NoQu), NoQu is the controller (the “Controller”).
        </p>
        <h5>Information we collect about you and how we use it</h5>
        <h5>Personal Information</h5>
        <p>We generally collect and process the following types of Personal Information: Personal Information which is
            being gathered through the Service consists of any personal details provided consciously and voluntarily by
            a Customer (Employer), End User or the Customer’s administrator or through your use of the NoQu Platform.
        </p>
        <p>This may include your name, gender, designation, phone number(s), department, employee ID, email address,
            company location, information the Customer chooses to collect and other information User may choose to
            provide to NoQu and to its employee.</p>
        <h5>Location Information:</h5>
        <p>If you are using the <b>NoQu Time and Attendance Management</b> (TAM) User App, We will utilize geo-fencing
            and capture your geolocation for time-keeping purposes. When using the NoQu TAM app, the Employer of the
            organization you are working for, may or may not enable GPS to capture geolocation. Geolocation services
            help Employers track your location for attendance management. The GDPR legal basis for processing this
            information is the contractual obligation to your Employer to perform the Services.</p>
        <p>For <b>NoQu Scan</b>, only geo-fencing is used and you (employees) cannot be actively tracked as your
            attendance is not marked through your personal devices.</p>
        <h5>Contact Information:</h5>
        <p>When you express an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services, the Site, or Mobile
            Apps, NoQu may ask you to provide your personal contact information, such as your name, email address, and
            phone number. This information is used to communicate with you by responding to your requests, comments and
            questions. The GDPR legal basis for processing this information is the legitimate interest in communicating
            with you and answering your questions.</p>
        <h5>Biometric & Attendance Information</h5>
        <p>We collect biometric data through our facial recognition feature to record check-ins/check-outs, if the
            Employer has requested logging in through face recognition. The face biometric is not used for any other
            purpose apart from enabling the attendance related services. The registered face data is retained as long as
            the User remains active and requires face recognition-based attendance services. This face data will be
            removed when the User is inactivated by the Account Owner. Additionally, the Account Owner can choose to
            remove the registered face of any active User if it is no longer needed as per organization processes. We do
            not share face data with any external third-parties except the sub-processor required for the operation of
            the App and to perform related services of user identification for time clocking. These sub-processors do
            not store user faces after the processing is completed.</p>
        <p>We collect time of check in/out and attendance data when you use the App. The GDPR legal basis for processing
            this information is the contractual obligation to your employer to perform the Services.</p>
        <h5>Device Information</h5>
        <p>When using the Mobile Apps, We may request access to your device’s camera and photo storage. This allows you
            to take and upload pictures and such access will only be used as per your choices. You can, at any time,
            revoke access at the device level. We do not access your device’s camera and photo storage without your
            permission. When you download and use the Mobile Apps, We automatically collect device information, such as
            the operating system version, type, hardware usage statistics, etc. The GDPR legal basis for processing this
            information is the contractual obligation to your Employer to perform the Services.</p>
        <h5>Non-personal Information</h5>
        <p>The first type of data is non-identifiable and anonymous information (“Non-personal Information”). We are not
            aware of the identity of the User from whom We have collected Non-Personal Information. Non-personal
            Information is any unconcealed information which is available to us while Users are using the Service or the
            website. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical and behavioral information,
            which may include the User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet,
            Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), operating system type, browser type, browser plug-in types and versions,
            screen resolution, Flash version, and time zone setting.</p>

        <p>As a service provider, NoQu systems only collect information as required by the Customer (Employer). Our
            Subscription Agreement governs the delivery, access, and use of the Services and Mobile Apps, including the
            processing of Personal Information and data submitted through Service accounts. The Customer (i.e. your
            Employer) controls their Platform and any associated client data. If you have any questions about specific
            Platform settings, the processing of Personal Information in the Platform, or its privacy practices, please
            contact the Customer Administrator of the Platform you use.</p>
        <p>As a data processor, We can provide a data processing agreement to Account Owners. If you are an Account
            Owner, you must comply with GDPR requirements. The Customer is responsible to collect any necessary consent,
            provide any notice where necessary to their respective End-Users and be compliant to applicable data
            protection laws. You can request a data processing agreement from us by emailing support@noqu.in.</p>

            practices of these Third-Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those

            restrict processing is respected in the future.</p>
        <h5>Right to data portability</h5>
        <h5>What does it mean?</h5>
        <p>Individuals have the right to transfer their personal data from one electronic processing system to and into
            another electronic processing system at will, and if requested, companies have the new GDPR standard of 30
            days to comply with the request. For example, switching from one social network to another or from one cloud
            provider to another.</p>
        <h5>How NoQu complies?</h5>
        <p>At your request, We will provide you with your Personal Information free of charge in a structured, commonly
            used, and machine-readable format if:</p>
        <p>• You provided us with your Personal Information;</p>
        <p>• The processing of your Personal Information is required for the performance of a contract;</p>
        <p>• Or The processing is carried out by automated means.</p>
        <h5>Right to object</h5>
        <h5>What does it mean?</h5>
        <p>Under GDPR, individuals have the "Right to Object” i.e. the data controllers can say that they no longer want
            the personal data processing to be carried out. In practice, the data subject can exercise the right to
            object more so with things related to direct marketing.</p>
        <h5>How NoQu complies?</h5>
        <p>Where We rely on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) to process your Personal Information,
            you have the right to object to such processing on grounds relating to your particular situation, if you
            believe it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms. We will comply with your request unless We have
            compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your rights and freedoms, or where the
            processing is in connection with the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. We will always
            comply with your objection to processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.</p>
        <h5>Rights in Relation to Automated Decision Making and Profiling</h5>
        <h5>What does it mean?</h5>
        <p>The GDPR has provisions on making a decision solely based on automated means without any human involvement,
            as well as the automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain aspects about an individual i.e.
            profiling. Profiling can be part of an automated decision-making process. GDPR applies to all forms of
            automated individual decision-making and profiling.</p>
        <h5>How NoQu complies?</h5>
        <p>You will not be subject to decisions with a legal or similarly significant effect (including profiling) that
            are based solely on the automated processing of your Personal Information, unless you have given us your
            explicit consent or when such processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with us.</p>
        <h5>Right to withdraw consent</h5>
        <p>You have the right to withdraw any consent you may have previously given us at any time. To exercise your
            rights in this section, We may ask you for certain identifying information to ensure the security of your
            Personal Information. To request to exercise any of the above rights, please contact us at support@noqu.in.
            We will respond to your request within 30 days or provide you with reasons for any delay.</p>
        <p>Usually, We will not charge you any fees in connection with the exercise of your rights. However, if your
            request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, such as due to its repetitive character, We may charge a
            reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of handling your request. If We refuse your
            request, We will notify you of the relevant reasons.</p>
